# Final Year Project
## Haskell DSL for smart contracts on the ethereum blockchain

This is a smart contract DSL written in haskell that will be able to produce ethereum bytecode. 

Currently, when run this evaluates a sample contract and shows how the contract is being evaluated in the output. 

## Run

### Cabal 
* `$ cabal run `
